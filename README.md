# Project
# Employee Attrition Analytics

A data‚Äëdriven HR analytics project to uncover the root causes of employee turnover and predict future attrition. 
Powered by Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit‚Äëlearn), SHAP explainability, and a Power BI dashboard.

# Tools & Tech Stack

- Python  
  - Pandas, NumPy ‚Äî data processing  
  - Seaborn, Matplotlib ‚Äî EDA visualizations  
  - Scikit‚Äëlearn ‚Äî classification modeling  
  - SHAP ‚Äî model explainability  
- **Power BI** ‚Äî interactive dashboarding  
- **Word/PowerPoint** ‚Äî documentation deliverables  


# Project Objective

1. **Analyze historical HR data** to identify the main drivers of employee resignation.  
2. **Build and evaluate** a classification model (Logistic Regression & Decision Tree) to predict who is likely to leave.  
3. **Explain model outputs** using SHAP values.  
4. **Visualize insights** in Power BI for actionable HR decision‚Äëmaking.  

Key Deliverables
Power BI Dashboard: Interactive charts & slicers for dept‚Äëwise attrition, salary bands, tenure, satisfaction, etc.

Model Accuracy Report: Metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC‚ÄëAUC) + confusion matrix.

SHAP Analysis: Feature‚Äëlevel explanations of individual attrition predictions.

Attrition Prevention Guide: PDF/Word doc with actionable HR strategies.

üîç Findings & Recommendations
High‚Äërisk factors: Low job satisfaction, long time since last promotion, high overtime, lower salary bands.
Top interventions: Career development programs, competitive compensation, work‚Äëlife balance policies, continuous monitoring via dashboards.
